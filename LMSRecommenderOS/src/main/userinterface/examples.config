Test 1 - Content-based CBR Recommender
Test 1 indicates a CBR Recommender with the approach of a content-based retrieval using the kNN classifier.<p> The data used in this test represents an e-learning environment with learning object cases.<p> Each case has description but it has not solution nor result.<br> The evaluation demonstrates the similarity between query and retrieved solution. There are two ways to evaluate the CBR Recommender:<p> - The first is an evaluator checking the similarity using each case as query applying it at the rest of the cases, so that result the number of queries as cases.<p> -The second evaluation consists in a cross-validation that splits the case base in two sets (25% and 75%): one used for testing where each case is used as query, and another that acts as normal case base.<p> Please, go through the Java Code of the LMSRecommender to get more information.

Test 2 - Filter-based CBR Recommender
Test 2 indicates a CBR Recommender with the approach of a filter-based retrieval using a filter method and the kNN classifier.<p> The data used in this test represents an e-learning environment with learning object cases.<p> Each case has description but it has not solution nor result.<br> The evaluation demonstrates the similarity between query and retrieved solution. There are two ways to evaluate the CBR Recommender:<p> - The first is an evaluator checking the similarity using each case as query applying it at the rest of the cases, so that result the number of queries as cases.<p> -The second evaluation consists in a cross-validation that splits the case base in two sets (25% and 75%): one used for testing where each case is used as query, and another that acts as normal case base.<p> Please, go through the Java Code of the LMSRecommender to get more information.

Test 3 - Collaborative CBR Recommender
Test 3 indicates a CBR Recommender with the approach based in collaborative-filtering retrieval using the Pearson Matrix as case base.<p> The data used in this test represents an e-learning environment with learning object cases.<p> Each case has description but it has not solution nor result.<br> The evaluation demonstrates the similarity between query and retrieved solution. There are two ways to evaluate the CBR Recommender:<p> - The first is an evaluator checking the similarity using each case as query applying it at the rest of the cases, so that result the number of queries as cases.<p> -The second evaluation consists in a cross-validation that splits the case base in two sets (25% and 75%): one used for testing where each case is used as query, and another that acts as normal case base.<p> Please, go through the Java Code of the LMSRecommender to get more information.

Test 4 - Collaborative Filter-based CBR Recommender
Test 4 indicates a CBR Recommender with the approach based in collaborative-filtering with an additional 'documents done' filter retrieval using the Pearson Matrix as case base.<p> This additional filter provides a general improve of the recommendations but is especially useful in the e-learning environment - normally nobody wants to do the same exercises again.<p> The data used in this test represents an e-learning environment with learning object cases.<p> Each case has description but it has not solution nor result.<br> The evaluation demonstrates the similarity between query and retrieved solution. There are two ways to evaluate the CBR Recommender:<p> - The first is an evaluator checking the similarity using each case as query applying it at the rest of the cases, so that result the number of queries as cases.<p> -The second evaluation consists in a cross-validation that splits the case base in two sets (25% and 75%): one used for testing where each case is used as query, and another that acts as normal case base.<p> Please, go through the Java Code of the LMSRecommender to get more information.
